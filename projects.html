    <h2 class="projectlabel" >StockX Data Analysis Project</h2>
    <p class="description">I studied the StockX Database containing 3 years of sales data containing 99,565 resales of collector shoes. I visualized that data using tools like Python with Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, SQL; and libraries like plotly, seaborn, and matplotlib. Models in the shoe collection .csv contains both 'Off-White' and 'Yeezy' variants of popular shoe models and gives the location, resale value, retail value and other information about the transaction. </p>
    <p class="description">Also 'Yeezy' sales often throughout the time frame of our sales data tend to show reactive measures to artist' Kanye West's political affiliations and Music/Album releases.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p class="description">• Above is the model of each 'Yeezy' shoe heatmapped by each month covered by our dataframe. The density of each spot in the heatmap represents the profit margin between the retail price and resale price. Below is the overall sales for every month in our data set, and we can see the profit decrease drastically over time.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="description">• Commonly, each model has a trend of having a high profit value on StockX and depreciates in resale value several months after the release of the shoe. So to really differentiate the data and visualize month per month differences, below I show a normalized version of the same heatmap. </p>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <p class="description">• Now that the data is normalized, we still notice a trend from a higher to lower profit margin as time passes in the data frame. However, We notice dark spots in our data on occasion, and they are grouped together so they must represent something that happened in the yeeze brand. </p>
    <p class="description">• Matching the plot order with the months of the dataset, we can match the darker spots to times where Kanye West has associated himself with a political party or had a bad PR experience regarding his music or features</p>
